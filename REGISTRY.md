# Registry

## 现在在哪里

- Public repository: `zinan92/wechat-miniprogram-shipping`.
- Existing published capability remains `$wechat-miniprogram-shipping`; no runtime behavior or installed-skill identity has changed yet.
- Ask Park single-entry, seven-module architecture is approved and merged in PR #5.
- Independent Ask Park QA Gate design is approved by Park and merged in PR #7. Its three-round independent review findings were addressed; the final two schema corrections were mechanically validated after the review ceiling and remain visible in the PR record.
- The L-level implementation plan is approved by architecture, QA/test, and packaging reviewers and merged in PR #11.
- Dependency-ordered implementation issues #12–#33 are published. V1 WIP is hard-capped at one.
- S00/#12 is complete in PR #36 (`0e2e9b6`): staged package layout, validator, and hermetic harness; 9/9 targeted tests passed, staged validation passed, gitleaks passed.
- S01/#13 is complete in PR #39 (`366edb0`): core state/receipt/applicability/human-gate contracts; 21/21 S01 tests plus 9/9 S00 tests passed, staged validation and gitleaks passed.
- S01B/#14 is now the only `ready-for-agent` story. Router, modules, QA workflows, migration, and forward evaluations remain unimplemented.

## 下一步

1. Implement [#14 / S01B](https://github.com/zinan92/wechat-miniprogram-shipping/issues/14): state-transition and receipt lifecycle engine.
2. Merge S01B after its gates pass, update this Registry, then make #15/S02 ready from the new `main`.
3. Preserve hard WIP=1 and the published dependency order through #33/S16D.
