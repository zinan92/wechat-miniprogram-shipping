# Registry

## 现在在哪里

- Public repository: `zinan92/wechat-miniprogram-shipping`.
- Existing published capability remains `$wechat-miniprogram-shipping`; no runtime behavior or installed-skill identity has changed yet.
- Ask Park single-entry, seven-module architecture is approved and merged in PR #5.
- Independent Ask Park QA Gate design is approved by Park and merged in PR #7. Its three-round independent review findings were addressed; the final two schema corrections were mechanically validated after the review ceiling and remain visible in the PR record.
- The L-level implementation plan is approved by architecture, QA/test, and packaging reviewers and merged in PR #11.
- Dependency-ordered implementation issues #12–#33 are published. V1 WIP is hard-capped at one; only #12/S00 carries `ready-for-agent`.
- Ask Park, the seven internal modules, QA Agent, manifest validator, migration, and forward evaluations are **not implemented**.

## 下一步

1. Implement [#12 / S00](https://github.com/zinan92/wechat-miniprogram-shipping/issues/12): staged package layout and hermetic test harness.
2. Merge S00 after its gates pass, update this Registry, then make #13/S01 ready from the new `main`.
3. Preserve hard WIP=1 and the published dependency order through #33/S16D.
